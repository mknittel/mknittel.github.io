Hello! As of Jan 10, I am a postdoc in computer science at UC San Diego. I work with Profs [Barna Saha](https://barnasaha.net/) and [Sanjoy Dasgupta](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/).on... to be determined! I am intrested in graph algorithms as the pertain to: (fair) machine learning, mechanism design, massively parallel computation, and more. In Spring '25, I will be an Assistant Professor at Reed College.

I received my PhD from the University of Maryland in 2023, where I studied under Profs [Mohammad Hajiaghayi](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/) and [John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com). Previously, I completed my BS in mathematics and computer science at Harvey Mudd College. There, I conducted research with Profs [Jessica Wu](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~yjw/) and [Jim Boerkoel](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~boerkoel/), as well as NASA's [Dr. Jeremy Frank](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/frank/). 

I have had a wide range of summer experiences throughout my education. Some of my past mentors include [Dr Cenk Sahinalp](https://ccr.cancer.gov/staff-directory/s-cenk-sahinalp), [Prof Avrim Blum](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~avrim/), [Prof Saeed Seddighin](https://sites.google.com/view/saeedrezaseddighin), [Prof Eric Allender](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~allender/), and [Prof Colleen Lewis](http://blogs.hmc.edu/lewis/). I have held tech internships at Google, Amazon, Meta, and Bloomberg.

If you are a Reed or UCSD student interested in working with me, feel free to shoot me an email!

I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) and I plan to graduate this Fall. My research is on large-scale graph algorithms, fairness in machine learning, computational geometry, and graphical models for economic markets. I am co-advised by [Prof. MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/) and [Prof. John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com). Upon graduation, I will begin a postdoc at the UCSD EnCORE institute, working with [Prof. Barna Saha](https://barnasaha.net/) and [Prof. Sanjoy Dasgupta](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/). I have been recognized by: the [Jane Street Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/programs-and-events/graduate-research-fellowship/) (finalist), the [Meta Research PhD Fellowship](https://research.facebook.com/fellowship/) (finalist), the [Ann G Wylie Dissertation Fellowship ](https://gradschool.umd.edu/funding/student-fellowships-awards/dissertation-fellowship), and the [ARCS Endowment Award](https://arcsfoundation.org/).

Previously, I attended [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/). In 2018, I completed my BS in Computer Science & Mathematics with high distinction, honors in math and computer science, as well as the Class of '94 award for outstanding course work, research, and service in CS. There, I conducted research in algorithms for computational biology with [Prof. Yi-Chieh (Jessica) Wu](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~yjw/) and in scheduling and planning with [Prof. Jim Boerkoel](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~boerkoel/) and [Dr. Jeremy Frank](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/frank/) of NASA Ames. I also partook in [csteachingtips](https://www.csteachingtips.org) with [Prof. Colleen Lewis](http://blogs.hmc.edu/lewis/). 

This summer, I developed intelligent models for predicting algorithmic runtime on distsributed architectures at Google. In previous summers, I have: explored tree edit distance as it relates to modeling cancer phylogeny with [Dr. Cenk Sahinalp](https://ccr.cancer.gov/staff-directory/s-cenk-sahinalp) (2023), studied the worst case execution time at Google (2022), interned at [TTIC](https://www.ttic.edu/) working with [Prof. Avrim Blum](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~avrim/) and [Prof. Saeed Seddighin](https://sites.google.com/view/saeedrezaseddighin) in algorithmic game theory (2021), researched intelligent embeddings of ads data at Amazon (2020), studied fairness in hierarchical clustering at Google (2019), developed neural networks for ranking problems at Facebook (2018), researched topics in complexity theory under [Prof. Eric Allender](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~allender/) at the Rutgers DIMACS REU (2017), and developed backend software at Bloomberg (2016).
