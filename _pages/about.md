I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/). My research is on large-scale graph algorithms, fairness in machine learning, computational geometry, and graphical models for economic markets. I am co-advised by [Prof. MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/) and [Prof. John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com). I received my MS in Computer Science from UMD in 2020.

Previously, I attended [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/). In 2018, I completed my BS in Computer Science & Mathematics with high distinction, honors in math and computer science, as well as the Class of '94 award for outstanding course work, research, and service in CS. There, I conducted research in algorithms for computational biology with [Prof. Yi-Chieh (Jessica) Wu](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~yjw/), and in scheduling and planning with [Prof. Jim Boerkoel](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~boerkoel/) and [Dr. Jeremy Frank](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/frank/) of NASA Ames. I also partook in [csteachingtips](csteachingtips.org) with [Prof. Colleen Lewis](http://blogs.hmc.edu/lewis/). 

This summer, I was a Research Scientist Intern at Amazon. In previous summers, I have: conducted theoretical machine learning research at Google (2019), developed machine learning algorithms at Facebook (2018), researched topics in complexity theory under [Prof. Eric Allender](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~allender/) at the Rutgers DIMACS REU (2017), and developed backend technology at Bloomberg (2016).
