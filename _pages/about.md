I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), where I also received my MS in 2020. My research is on large-scale graph algorithms, fairness in machine learning, computational geometry, and graphical models for economic markets. I am co-advised by [Prof. MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/) and [Prof. John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com). In 2021-2022, my work will be supported by the [Ann G Wylie Dissertation Fellowship ](https://gradschool.umd.edu/funding/student-fellowships-awards/dissertation-fellowship) and the [ARCS Endowment Award](https://arcsfoundation.org/).

Previously, I attended [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/). In 2018, I completed my BS in Computer Science & Mathematics with high distinction, honors in math and computer science, as well as the Class of '94 award for outstanding course work, research, and service in CS. There, I conducted research in algorithms for computational biology with [Prof. Yi-Chieh (Jessica) Wu](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~yjw/) and in scheduling and planning with [Prof. Jim Boerkoel](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~boerkoel/) and [Dr. Jeremy Frank](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/frank/) of NASA Ames. I also partook in [csteachingtips](csteachingtips.org) with [Prof. Colleen Lewis](http://blogs.hmc.edu/lewis/). 

This summer, I will be interning at [TTIC](https://www.ttic.edu/) working with [Prof. Avrim Blum](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~avrim/) and [Prof. Saeed Seddighin](https://sites.google.com/view/saeedrezaseddighin) in algorithmic game theory. In previous summers, I have: researched intelligent embeddings of ads data at Amazon (2020), studied fairness in hierarchical clustering at Google (2019), developed neural networks for ranking problems at Facebook (2018), researched topics in complexity theory under [Prof. Eric Allender](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~allender/) at the Rutgers DIMACS REU (2017), and developed backend software at Bloomberg (2016).
