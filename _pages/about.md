As of Fall of 2019, I am a second year PhD student and Dean's Fellow in the Computer Science Department at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/). I have the pleasure to work with [Prof. MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/) on problems in hierarchical clustering and distributed graph algorithms for big data. I also work with [Prof. John Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com) on using stable marriage to model the faculty hiring market.

Previously, I attended [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/). In 2018, I completed my BS in Computer Science & Mathematics with high distinction, honors in math and computer science, as well as the Class of '94 award for outstanding course work, research, and service in CS. There, I conducted research in algorithms for computational biology with [Prof. Yi-Chieh (Jessica) Wu](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~yjw/), and in scheduling and planning with [Prof. Jim Boerkoel](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~boerkoel/) and [Dr. Jeremy Frank](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/frank/) of NASA Ames. I also partook in [csteachingtips](csteachingtips.com) with [Prof. Colleen Lewis](http://blogs.hmc.edu/lewis/). 

In addition, I spent the Summer of 2017 at the Rutgers DIMACS REU researching topics in complexity theory under [Prof. Eric Allender](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~allender/). I have had two summer internships doing backend work at Bloomberg and machine learning at Facebook. This summer, I conducted theoretical machine learning research at Google Seattle.
